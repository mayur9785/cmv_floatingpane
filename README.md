# cmv_floatingpane
When application run I have my own custom layout so it will display two divs on page top left and bottom withing the map div
Click on the show/Hide button located on the left side to hide divs 
Click on Draw button to open the draw floating pane widget. This is the CMV draw widget with few changes in files.
I am trying to load the widgets in Floating pane instead of sidebar
I am able to load draw widgets in Floating pane (Open/Close, Expand/Collapse,movable & Resizable) instead in sidebar
As of now I am trying to load LayerControl widgets to load in Floating pane as this is my first priority to get it done, but later of course I would like  to use other CMV widgets and plus plan to use WAB widgets as well.
I am unable to load LayerControl widgets so feel free to check and share the working code if you are done.
